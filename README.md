# FUN WITH COMPUTER VISION
 The dino game in chrome browser is automated with the eye blinks. Using haar cascade face and eye detection model (pre trained) I have automated the game. When the camera will detect an eye blink dino will jump. Basically here haar cascade model of OpenCv is used to control the game using eye blinks instead of hitting the space bar.
